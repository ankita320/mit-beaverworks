level 20:  ls the files and there is the red on bandit20-do, so  file-d that to see the type and it had "setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable" so i set the id for that by doing that file and then id to set the id, the command can be given as another user), i then used that after setting it where it would cat from etc/pass with that set id. since etc/pass is a directory it would be bandit20; the password is catted from that file through with that set user.
